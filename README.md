Using XGboost to build a similar model to the Pytorch one on the same music metadata dataset yields results of 93% (!) accuracy at prediction TV show placements based upon metadata alone.
The some qualities baked into the metadata on these tracks is apparently enough to accurately predict whether or not a track will end up on a TV show, the next step will be to create a 
generative model that produces metadata that fulfills the target attribute so that I can actually write tracks that match those qualities to pitch to tv shows.
